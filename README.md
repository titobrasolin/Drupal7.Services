Drupal7.Services
================

.NET API to integrate with Drupal 7 via XML-RPC and Services 3 module.

The DrupalServices class “wraps” around a proxy generated by Charles Cook's excellent XML-RPC.NET library and provides a number of convenience methods to consume Drupal services both synchronously and asynchronously.

It is splitted into partial classes to facilitate ease of reading and maintenance.

Quickstart
----------

Drupal7.Services (prerelease) is available in NuGet.

After installation, create a new instance of DrupalServices passing the url of your to the constructor:

    string url = "http://www.strongmonkey.net/services/xmlrpc";
    Drupal7.Services.DrupalServices d = new Drupal7.Services.DrupalServices (url);

Then call NodeIndex to retrieve an array of Drupal nodes:

    int page = 0;
    string fields = "*";
    int size = 20;
    CookComputing.XmlRpc.XmlRpcStruct[] n = d.NodeIndex (page, fields, size);
